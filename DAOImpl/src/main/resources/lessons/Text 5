The Docks.
The mouth of the river Thames is very wide, and large ships go up it from the sea to London. Near the river we see special places which we call the docks. All kinds of ships, large and small, go into these docks. Many workers work in these docks. They are dockers. At the side of each dock you can see railway lines.
Ocean ships from all parts of the world come to London. They can go up the Thames to London Bridge. When you look at the plan of London you can see two docks at the right-hand side of the map. One of them is small. The other is big. At the end of each dock we can see a big gate. When a ship comes, the workers must open the gate for the ship. They open the gate and the ship goes into the dock.
You can go to London by sea or by air. It takes only two or three hours^ to fly to England from almost any part of Europe. Or you may go by ship to Dover and from there by railway to any place in England which you want to see.
